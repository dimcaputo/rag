Iron-catalyzed Kumada cross-couplings of aryl Grignard reagents with secondary alkyl iodides are an efficient means to achieve sp 3 -sp 2 C /C0 C bond formation, [9] and we questioned whether the tertiary iodide resident in an iodo-BCP could engage in this coupling manifold. While isolated examples of Fe-catalyzed Kumada couplings of tertiary alkyl bromides and chlorides have been described, [9d,10] the equivalent reaction of tertiary iodides is, to our knowledge, unknown. Here we describe the development of iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of iodo-BCPs with both aryl and heteroaryl Grignard reagents, which represents the first general procedure for the direct cross-coupling of iodo-BCP electrophiles.

These examples emphasize the mild conditions and functional group tolerance of this methodology.\n\nThe mechanistic pathways of iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are dependent on a number of factors, including the nature of the Grignard reagent, the rate of its addition, the additive (ligand), and solvent. [9i, 17] The formation of iron nanoparticles may also be observed, in particular under a 'rapid addition' (of Grignard) regime. [18] In our system, a distinctive colour change from orange/red to dark/ black was observed during Grignard addition which may indicate nanoparticle formation, [19] albeit this is not commonly observed under 'slow' addition regimes. [13a] The presence of substoichiometric TMEDA is also clearly beneficial to reaction efficiency, [9j, 20] although its role is unclear given evidence that it may not be ligated to the metal during the coupling process.
